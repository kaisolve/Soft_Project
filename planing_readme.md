    Project Scope Definition:
        we Define the primary objective of the app: to calculate BMI based on user input.
        we Identify key features: input fields for gender, height, weight, and age; calculation of BMI; display of BMI category.
        we Determine any secondary features or stretch goals.

    ### User Use Cases:
        we Create user use cases to outline the interactions users will have with the app.
        Example: As a user, I want to input my gender, height, weight, and age so that I can calculate my BMI.

    Wireframing and UI Design:
        we create mockups of the app's user interface and Plan the layout of input fields, buttons, and result display areas,
        Considering usability principles and design patterns.

    Technical Requirements:
        we Determine the technical stack: Flutter for cross-platform development, any additional packages for calculations or UI design.
        we don't need any data storage options.

    Task Breakdown and Timeline:
        we Break down the development tasks into smaller units (e.g., UI implementation, logic implementation, testing).
        we Estimate the time required for each task and create a development timeline.
        we Consider dependencies between tasks and potential bottlenecks.

    Resource Allocation:
        we Identify team members or roles responsible for each task.

    Risk Assessment and Mitigation:
        Identify potential risks to the project's success (e.g., technical challenges, resource constraints, time delays).
        Develop strategies to mitigate each risk, such as alternative approaches or contingency plans.

    Quality Assurance Plan:
        we Define testing strategies: unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing.
        and Determine criteria for success and acceptance of each feature.
        Plan for bug tracking and issue resolution throughout the development process.

    Feedback Mechanisms:
        we Establish feedback mechanisms for stakeholders, team members, and potential users.
        we Schedule regular review meetings or demo sessions to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

    Documentation and Communication:
        finaly we Document the project plan, including requirements, design decisions, and development tasks.
        Communicating the plan and updates to all stakeholders, ensuring alignment and transparency throughout the project.
